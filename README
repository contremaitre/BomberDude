I am trying to create a good open source bomberman, because I couldn't find one.
My reference is Atomic Bomberman which is very fun but unmaintained, closed source, and run only under Windows.
I am using QT.
Anyone can join the project, just contact me.

INSTALL :
(QT >= 4.6 required)
qmake -project "QT += network" "CONFIG += debug"
qmake
make

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STATUS :
done :
- random map creation
- pixmaps loading
- player movements with arrow keys
- client/server model

started :
- Player animation (QPropertyAnimation)

todo :
- players more sophisticated (create a class with attributes like speed, bomb capacity etc...)
- Settings and menu screen, add more options etc...
- drop bombs and break bricks
- auto configuration scripts to build the project
- menu
- configuration screen (to change the gameplay, keys, connect or launch a server) etc...
- bonus
- custom map creation (with xml files)
- graphics
- find another name for the game

less important :
- udp stats
- ping
