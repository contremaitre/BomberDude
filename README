I am trying to create a good open source bomberman, because I couldn't find one.
My reference is Atomic Bomberman which is very fun but unmaintained, closed source, and run only under Windows.
I am using QT.
Anyone can join the project, just contact me.

INSTALL :
qmake -project "QT += network"
qmake
make

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STATUS :
done :
- random map creation
- pixmaps loading
- player one movement with arrow keys

started :
- client/server model (next steps : the server must know the map / comminucation between GamePlay - NetClient - NetServer)

todo :
- players more sophisticated (create a class with attributes like speed, bomb capacity etc...)
- drop bombs and break bricks
- auto configuration scripts to build the project
- networking
- menu
- configuration screen (to change the gameplay, keys, connect or launch a server) etc...
- bonus
- custom map creation (with xml files)
- graphics
- find another name for the game
