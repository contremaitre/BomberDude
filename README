I'd like to create a good open source bomberman, because I couldn't find one.
My reference is Atomic Bomberman which is very fun but unmaintained, closed source, and run only under Windows.

I will use QT.
Anyone can join the project, just contact me.

INSTALL :
qmake -project
qmake
make

STATUS :
done :
- map creation
- pixmaps loading

next step :
- ability to move players and change pixmaps on the fly
