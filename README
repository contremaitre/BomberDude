I am trying to create a good open source bomberman, because I couldn't find one.
My reference is Atomic Bomberman which is very fun but unmaintained, closed source, and run only under Windows.
I am using QT.
Anyone can join the project, just contact me.

INSTALL :
(QT >= 4.6 required)
qmake
make

Status :
https://github.com/contremaitre/QtBomberman/issues

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*** Cross compil for windows (improvments welcome) ****
copy Qt sdk 4.x for win32 in your linux filesystem
install mingw
patch a win32-x-g++ qmake.conf according to http://silmor.de/29
/!\ remove the debug_and_release flag, otherwise the compilation won't work because of debug/ and release/ subdirectories path
run qmake -spec win32-x-g++
To create a qtb package, copy QtBomberman.exe, pictures folder, maps folder and the following dll's :
QtCore4.dll
QtGui4.dll
QtNetwork4.dll
mingwm10.dll
libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll
QtSvg4.dll
imageformats/qsvg4.dll
For the server (Serverd.exe) :
QtXml4.dll
