I am trying to create a good open source bomberman, because I couldn't find one.
My reference is Atomic Bomberman which is very fun but unmaintained, closed source, and run only under Windows.
I am using QT.
Anyone can join the project, just contact me.

INSTALL :
(QT >= 4.6 required)
qmake
make

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STATUS :

todo :
- players more sophisticated (attributes like speed, bomb capacity etc...)
- auto configuration scripts to build the project (CMAKE ?)
- menu
- configuration screen (to change the gameplay, keys) etc...
- bonus
- find another name for the game

Known Bug :
- if the GUI launch a server, but a server is already running on the same computer, then the client will be connected to the local server
instead of failling
- The standalone server doesn't reload maps when all players left anymore
