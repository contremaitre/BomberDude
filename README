I am trying to create a good open source bomberman, because I couldn't find one.
My reference is Atomic Bomberman which is very fun but unmaintained, closed source, and run only under Windows.
I am using QT.
Anyone can join the project, just contact me.

INSTALL :
(QT >= 4.6 required)
qmake
make

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STATUS :

todo :
- implement all bonus from AB
- auto configuration scripts to build the project (CMAKE ?)
- work on the gui, design a nice one.
- find another name for the game

Known Bug :
Server does not work on win32, there is a timer issue, not started in its thread
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*** Cross compil for windows (improvments welcome, see TODO) ****
copy Qt sdk 4.x for win32 in your linux filesystem
install mingw
patch a win32-x-g++ qmake.conf according to http://silmor.de/29
run qmake -spec win32-x-g++
(TODO) qtb librairies are compiled in the wrong folder, you'll have to move, for example common/release/libcommon.a to common/libcommon.a
(TODO) ranlib is not called, so you'll have to manualy run /usr/bin/i586-mingw32msvc-ranlib to every .a generated by qtb
To create a qtb package, copy QtBomberman.exe, pictures folder, maps folder and the following dll's :
QtCore4.dll
mingwm10.dll
libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll
QtGui4.dll
QtNetwork4.dll
