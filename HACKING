Network :
connection protocol :
NetClient connects to NetServer (tcp)
NetServer creates a NetServerClient instance for this client.
NetClient binds a udp socket to the same port than the local tcp socket port (this way, the server knows which client sent the udp datagram)
NetClient sends a udp welcome message
NetServer replies to this client with a udp welcome message
NetServer/NetServerClient and NetClient can comunicate.
   - NetServer receives udp datagrams (moves...)
   - NetServerClient receives tcp messages

When started from the GUI, a random password is generated, and the server is launched as a new process with it.
The GUI then send this password to be the admin of the game.
When started from command line, an optionnal password can be set with --admin-password
If no password is set, the first client connected is the admin
If a client is connected with a password, he can shutdown the server.
