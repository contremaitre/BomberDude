Programer guide :

Network :
We send players move with udp, everything else with tcp.
connection protocol :
NetClient connects to NetServer (tcp)
NetServer creates a NetServerClient instance for this client.
NetClient binds a udp socket to the same port than the local tcp socket port (this way, the server knows which client sent the udp datagram)
NetClient sends a udp welcome message
NetServer replies to this client with a udp welcome message
NetServer/NetServerClient and NetClient can comunicate.
   - NetServer receives udp datagrams (moves)
   - NetServerClient receives tcp messages
